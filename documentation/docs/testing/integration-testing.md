# Integration tests

Tests to demonstrate each use-case based on the use-case descriptions and the sequence diagrams. External input 
should be provided via mock objects and results verified via mock objects. Integration tests should not require 
manual entry of data nor require manual interpretation of results.

## Purpose
Integration testing verifies that different components of our application work together as expected. Unlike 
unit tests that test individual components, integration tests ensure that the flow between use cases and their 
interconnected features functions correctly.

## Integration with Use Cases
1. **Room Setup -> Player Join Flow**
   - Links Use Case 1 (Room Management) with Use Case 3 (Player Joins)
   - Tests that:
     - Room creation successfully enables player joining
     - Room codes are properly generated and validated
     - Player limits are enforced

2. **Player Setup -> Game Start Flow**
   - Links Use Case 2 (Player Customization) with Use Case 4 (Accessibility & AAC)
   - Tests that:
     - Player profiles are properly created and stored
     - AAC keyboard is properly initialized for each player

3. **Gameplay Flow Integration**
   - Links Use Case 5 (Cloze Phrase Education) with Use Case 6 (Collaboration)
   - Tests that:
     - Turn transitions work correctly between players
     - Story progression updates for all players
     - Answer submissions properly update game state

4. **Settings and Difficulty Integration**
   - Links Use Case 7 (Difficulty Scaling) with ongoing gameplay
   - Tests that:
     - Difficulty changes properly affect question complexity
     - Game state maintains consistency during difficulty changes

## Example Integration Test Flow

Here's an example of how we test the Room Creation â†’ Player Join flow:

```typescript
describe('Room Creation and Join Flow', () => {
  it('should allow player to join after room creation', async () => {
    // Test complete flow from room creation to successful join
    // 1. Create room
    // 2. Generate room code
    // 3. Join with code
    // 4. Verify connection
  });
});
```
