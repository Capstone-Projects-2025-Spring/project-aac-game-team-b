# Unit tests
(For each method, one or more test cases. A test case consists of input parameter values and expected results. 
All external classes should be stubbed using mock objects.)

# Purpose
The Test Procedures describe the test approach and the tests to be performed to verify the requirements 
specified in the Requirements Document.

# Library Explanation
We chose Jest along with the React Testing Library.

## Jest
- **Primary Testing Framework**
- Selected because:
    - Code coverage reporting
    - Mocking ability
    - Perfect integration with React and Next.js

## React Testing Library
- **UI Testing Utility**
- Selected because:
    - Simulates user testing

## Setup
1. Required Dependencies
   ```json
   {
     "jest": "^27.0.0",
     "@testing-library/react": "^12.0.0",
     "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.0.0"
   }
   ```

2. Running Tests
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm test
   
   # Run with coverage
   npm test -- --coverage
   
   # Run specific test file
   npm test -- page.test.tsx
   ```

## Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Component/Method Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup code
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });
});
```

## Test Cases and Implementation
Our unit tests are located in `StoryQuest/app/Gameplay/__tests__/page.tsx`. 

Here are the key test cases:
### `handleWordSelect()`
This method processes word selections and is tested through both direct word selection and AAC interface. The 
test `handles word selection through AAC keyboard` demonstrates this by clicking the "mouse" button and 
verifying the phrase updates from "Look in the garden, there is a ___" to include "mouse". Error handling is 
verified through the `handles invalid word selection gracefully` test.

### `handleAddImage()`
This method manages image rendering and positioning, tested through the `displays images when words are 
selected` test. It verifies both image presence and correct positioning after word 
selection, specifically checking for proper rendering of 'mouse.svg' and other story images.

### `handleAACSelect()`
This method handles AAC interface interactions, tested extensively in `handles word selection through AAC 
keyboard`. It verifies proper button functionality and includes error 
handling as shown in the invalid word selection test.

### `renders without crashing`
This test ensures basic component rendering functionality. It verifies the presence of the "Select Story:" 
text, demonstrating proper initial component mounting. No mocks are needed for this basic rendering test.

### `initializes with the first story`
This test verifies proper initialization state. It checks for the default story's first phrase "Look in the 
garden, there is a ___", ensuring the story data is properly loaded and displayed on component mount.

### `allows story selection from dropdown`
This test verifies the story selection UI. It checks for both the presence of the dropdown and its correct 
default value ("The Garden Adventure"), demonstrating proper integration between the UI and story data.

### `handles word selection through AAC keyboard`
This test verifies the complete word selection flow. It simulates AAC button clicks and verifies phrase 
updates, demonstrating integration between the AAC interface and phrase display.

### `displays images when words are selected`
This test ensures proper image handling. It verifies both image rendering and positioning after word 
selection, checking specific CSS properties and image presence in the DOM.

### `shows "The End!" when all sections are completed`
This test verifies game completion logic. It simulates completing story sections and checks for the appearance 
of the completion message, demonstrating proper game flow handling.

### `handles invalid word selection gracefully`
This test verifies error handling. It uses a Jest spy on window.alert to verify proper error messaging when 
invalid words are selected, demonstrating robust error handling in the AAC interface.


## Test coverage report:
npx jest --coverage: rn it doesnt go to 100% for all the files.
