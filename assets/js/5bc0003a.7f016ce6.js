This is a story-based quiz game\nin which users must fill in the blanks according to pictures on the screen, made to enhance communication and collaboration among school age children\nwho use AAC and school age children who do not. Users can open the web application for our game and either 'Host' or 'Join' a game. Our frontend will contain the 'Host' mode and the\n'Player' mode. Within the 'Player' mode, the game will display questions, and utilizes a built-in AAC tablet on which a Player answers. Once a Player has chosen an answer, the choice\nis sent to the backend to be verified. Answers are sent directly to a database for validation, and once validated, the database sends a response back (Correct/Incorrect) to the frontend to be displayed."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"selecting-technology--cost-considerations",children:"Selecting Technology & Cost Considerations"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"frontend--client-side",children:"Frontend / Client-side"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"For the frontend we are considering a Next.js framework, hosted on Vercel, under the \"Hobby\" plan.

We are also considering Firebase, to further smooth communication between the frontend/backend\nand host both the app and database. Firebase is mainly a free service, but on the 'Blaze' plan it is Pay-As-You-Go. Firebase has free cloud hosting for up to 10 GB (about 5000 static pages), free database\nusage for up to 2 GB (about 40 M chat messages), and free cloud storage for up to 5 GB (up to 2500 high-res photos). We believe that StoryQuest will be well below the limits of the Firebase pricing plan, as we mainly plan\nto store correct answers, storylines, and small images.
